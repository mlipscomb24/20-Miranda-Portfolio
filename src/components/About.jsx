        Hello! I'm Miranda, a passionate and innovative web developer with a
        keen interest in creating responsive and user-friendly applications.
        With a background in Product Developemtn, I bring a unique
        perspective to every project I undertake.
      </p>
      <p>
        My journey in web development began in 2024 when I registered for a UT Coding Bootcamp.
        Since then, I've honed my skills in various technologies including
        React, Node.js, and Javascript. I'm particularly
        excited about UX Design.
      </p>
      <p>
        When I'm not coding, you can find me out in town trying new food or exploring the city on a bike. I
        believe that a well-rounded life fuels creativity and problem-solving in
        my professional work.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm always eager to take on new challenges and collaborate on exciting
        projects. If you're looking for a dedicated developer who can bring
        fresh ideas and solid technical skills to your team, I'd love to
        connect!
